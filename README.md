 <p>"The foundations of sustainable growth are peace, justice, and strong institutions." This important detail was overlooked during the hurried MDG formulation. The idea that everyone, including the government and other official entities, should be held responsible for their actions and that a country should be governed by the law is known as the rule of law. We therefore reasoned that people need to be made aware of the law. So, we implemented a legal application. The best method for educating people about the law is this one. Users can ask questions about the law using this app and quickly get their questions answered. Using this program, people can read books and articles about law. In addition to these things, we let people know about legal advertisements and events. They can take part in these events and learn about the law if they want to. Additionally, they can broaden their legal knowledge. build effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions at all levels and promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development. Ensure public access to information and protect fundamental freedoms, in accordance with national legislation and international agreements.<p>
